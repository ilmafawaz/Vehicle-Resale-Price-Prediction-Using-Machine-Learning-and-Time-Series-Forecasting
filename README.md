## Vehicle Resale Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Time Series Forecasting
This project develops a data-driven approach to estimate and forecast vehicle resale prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using Random Forest regression for current price prediction and LSTM neural networks for trend-based forecasting.
The Random Forest model achieved strong predictive performance, demonstrating the importance of vehicle age, mileage, and brand-related features in resale valuation. Time-series modelling using LSTM was implemented to explore future price movement patterns.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib and Seaborn

Techniques Applied:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Deep Learning Forecasting
- Model Evaluation and Visualisation
This project shows how predictive analytics can support pricing strategies and market competitiveness in the automotive resale industry.
